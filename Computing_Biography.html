      <h1>Computing Biography</h1>
      <p>
        Within the past 5 semesters, I learned several programming languages and
        the use of specific computer software.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">
              C/C++:
            </span>
            very good knowledge. In Germany about 80 percent of the graduated Electronic
            Engineers will be employed in an industrial environment which
            requires very good knowledge of C/C++. Especially the field
            of Embedded Systems growed very important during the last decades.
            Therefore, my German home university taught me during the first three
            semesters a lot about C and also C++.
            Due to my internships and my non-term jobs in the automotive branch
            I also got to know the practical aspect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">
              Assembling:
            </span>
            good knowledge. As a basic programming language, the assembling language is still
            today very important. Especially when the code size is strongly
            limited or an existing high-language code has to be optimized.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">
              Matlab
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">
              VHDL
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">
              LabVIEW
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Even if my major includes a very good education in Embedded Systems
        languages, we learn neither HTML, CSS nor JAVA at all.
        When I chose my courses for my semester abroad at CSU, Chico I was very
        happy about the offered course CINS110: no pre-requeresits and a basic
        introduction.
        Even if my home university will not give me credits for attending this
        class, it is still worth it for me. My motivation is to learn how to build
        a webpage and also get to know the basics in JavaScript.
