        Even if my major is Electronic Engineering and Information Systems,
        I don't spend much time in front of a PC in my spare time.
        I like all kinds of outdoor sport activities like hiking, survival camping,
        jogging and swimming. I also never miss my camera during these outdoor
        activities as photography is another hobby of mine.

        Furthermore I love working with wood, so I build
        things like outdoor furniture or small summer houses.
        To finance my study, I turned my hobbies into an job and sell the woodden
        things which I build.
        The log house from the picture was my biggest project so far. It took
        nearly two months to build it.

        As I work a lot with machines and tools from the company STIHL, my dream
        is to get a STIHL engineer. As a first step, I completed
        an internship at STIHL. The company really fascinates me. The electronical
        and Embedded Systems division of STIHL spend lots
        of money for development and research.
        Because of my good achievements, STIHL gave me a scholarship for my
        remaining study. My goal is to work at STIHL as an engineer after my
        bachelor's degree.
